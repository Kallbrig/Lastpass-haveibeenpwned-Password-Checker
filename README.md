# Lastpass haveibeenpwned Password Checker
 
* A script that checks your lastpass library against the haveibeenpwned api to see if any of your passwords have been cracked.

* I'd advise running this as a cron job.

* You'll need a Gmail account and a Lastpass account to run this script. Add your credentials for each account in credentials.py.
